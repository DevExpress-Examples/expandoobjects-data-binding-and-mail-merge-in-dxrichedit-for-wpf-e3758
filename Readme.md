# ExpandoObjects - data binding and mail merge in DXRichEdit for WPF


<p>This example illustrates that .NET 4.0 dynamic types (ExpandoObject) can be bound to DXRichEdit and used for mail merge. <br />
RichEditControl has this capability starting from the 11.2.8 version. <br />
The example shows how to load XML data form a file into a List<dynamic> containing ExpandoObject instances. Sample data are weather reports obtained via Google weather service. <br />
You can use hierarchically organized dynamic types for mail merge. This example creates data composed of the current time stamp and the weather data loaded from a file. Nested weather data are specified as the MERGEFIELD field parameter using dot notation.</p><br />
